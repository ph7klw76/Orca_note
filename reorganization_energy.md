1- optimize the geometry of S1, pick up the TOTAL energy of S1 in the optimized geometry of S1. This is "E1". 
This TOTAL energy is given just below the line indicating the energy, wavelength and oscillator strength of "Excited State 1". 
2- optimize the geometry of T1. Once you have this T1 geometry, calculate again the singlets at the T1 optimized geometry, and pick up the TOTAL energy of S1 ; this is E2.
3- lambda = E2-E1"
