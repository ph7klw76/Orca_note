# NOTE
For systems where triplet states are energetically close to singlet states, enabling triplet calculations ensures that these interactions are properly accounted for, which is essential for accurate modeling of photochemical and photophysical properties.

ExtParamXC "_omega" in ORCA is used to modify the 
Ï‰ parameter for range-separated hybrid functionals. This parameter controls the separation of short-range and long-range contributions in these functionals. The ExtParamXC syntax allows users to customize this and other parameters provided by the LibXC interface.
